From: Mark L. Barrett, 76462,1005To: Blue Byte, 100064,3503Date: Son, 10. Sep 1995, 2:30 UhrRE: Albion textsJurie,Everything arrived fine this time.  A thousand years from now we'll probably be sending messages to colonies on other planets in ASCII.I know you said you weren't expecting me to correct this, or send it back, but that's really the easiest way for me to comment in full.  The short answer to your question is that some of what you sent has a flat sound to it: it's not incomprehensible, but the way it sounds to my ear, and will sound to the ear of your average game-playing American, is as if a C# were suddenly sounded in the middle of a piece played in C. I've made some notes, and tried to put in some examples of how I would change some of your selected text.  It's a little tough because I don't know who's speaking - narrator, character, etc. - or what the tone is supposed to be, but I'm just trying to show how to clean up the same lines and make them ring "true" to the American ear.(Hahahaha...as it suddenly occurs to Barrett that some of the work he's about to savage could very well be Jurie's...haha...cough...ack.)Suggested changes follow MB:.  Comments are in ().Block 1: [The floor panel in front of the door lights up when trodden on, and at the same time the door opens.](I don't know here if "trodden on" is part of the language you're using in the game, or if it comes from the translators.  I'd junk it in a second and use "stepped on" in its place in my example.  If trodden is important, I'd think long and hard about using "trod upon" for the ring of it, even if the past paticiple trodden is grammatically correct.)MB: When trodden on, the floor panel in front of the door lights up and the door opens.Block 2: [Floor panel lights up.](I'd want to put "The" or "A" at the front of this one, but not if we've already seen this line thirty or forty times.)MB: The floor panel lights up.Block 3: [Here there is a floor panel with a transparent illuminated surface.](This line would sound right to my ear if it were delivered by - and I'm not try to be funny or sarcastic here - an eldery British museum guide.  I'm really suffering (Aw!!!) not knowing the context, so keep that in mind as I mangle this line.)MB: The [This] floor panel has a transparent illuminated surface.-or-MB: The [This] floor panel's transparent surface glows.Block 4: [When this floor panel lights up, the door in the "west" of the room opens.]MB: When the floor panel lights up, the door to the west opens.Block 5: [A switch.](I keep wanting to see a direct address to a lot of these things (_You see_ a switch), but I'm guessing that's because I've no context, and because I don't know how the player is being addressed through interface.)Block 6: [The position of the switch will not change when it is pressed again.](This is tricky from a suspension of disbelief/tense perspective.  If this line actually shows _before_ the player touches the switch (which is what the tense of "will not" infers) it anticipates a player's action, and thus plays the game for them.  If the line shows _after_ the player has tried the switch again, these would be better:)MB: The position of the switch does not change when pressed again.-or- (after each subsequent press)MB: The position of the switch does not change.Block 7: [The door tries to close, but remains open. A sensor must have registered that someone else is in the doorway.](From a design aspect, obviously you recognize that you're giving the player a direct clue here, so I'll keep that intact.)MB: The door starts to close, then opens.  A sensor must have registered someone else in the way.Block 8: [There is a wall cupboard on the "north" wall.](This is just redundant - all cupboards are on walls.  For what it's worth, I don't think you need the quotes around the directions either).MB: There is a cupboard on the north wall.Block 9: [The wall cupboard is empty, ready to put objects in.](The clunkiness of this sentence is pretty strong, but that's due mostly to the clue/hint in the line (if that's what's being suggested.) MB: The cupboard is empty, ready for storing objects.-or- (without clue)MB: The cupboard is empty.Block 10: [A wall cupboard.]MB: A cupboard.Block 11: [The noise came from the right, quite a distance away.]MB: The noise came from far off to the right.-or-MB: The noise came from far to the right.Block 12: [As soon as the door with the red lights opens, the one at the back with the green markings shuts. The way back is blocked!]MB: As the door with the red lights opens, the door with the green markings shuts.  The way back is blocked!Block 13: [This must be a service robot. It is carrying out some unknown task.]("Must be" here sounds more determinative than I think is meant, as in: "You _must be_ a doctor when you grow up!")MB: This looks like a service robot, carrying out some unknown task.-or- (clear and direct information)MB: A service robot, carrying out some unknown task.Block 14: [A door. You can't see how to open it.](AHA!  I knew there had to be a "You see" loitering around here somewhere.  This allows me a little more latitude.)MB: A door - you can't see how it opens.-or-MB: You see a door, but can't see how it opens.Block 15: [A fluorescent tube. It sheds a cold white light.]MB: A fluorescent tube, shedding a cold white light.Block 16: [A steel girder.](Girder can be used over here, but more common to the layman is "I-beam", and more common still is simply "beam".  If girder isn't necessary for its specific structural usage, I'd change it.)MB: A steel I-beam.-or-MB: A steel beam.Block 17: [The translucent walls indicate a service entrance. The ladder in the centre leads upwards.]("Center" en Etats-Unis.)Block 18: [A numeric keypad for entering number codes.]MB: A numeric keypad for entering numbers.Block 19: [A door with red lights at the side. There is no opening mechanism to be seen.]MB: A door, red lights at the side.  No opening mechanism can be seen.-or-MB: A door, red lights to its side.  No way to open it can be seen.Block 20: [A door with green lights at the side. There is no opening mechanism to be seen.](See my response to Block 19.)Block 21: [A door with blue lights at the side.  There is no opening mechanism to be seen.](See my response to Block 19.)Block 22: [The number combination must have been correct: the door next to the keypad has opened.](Assuming they know there's a door there, and what they're trying to do is get through the damn thing:)MB: The combination must have been correct - the door has opened!Block 23: [Nothing's happening.](This is fine as an American sentece, but context is critical.  It's possible you may want "Nothing happens.")Block 24: [Yeah!  Made it!](Sounds fine, but has a different tone and cadence than much of the above.  I'd guess this must be a line for a character.  Need ""?)Block 25: [A ladder. It leads upwards.](Just a dumb note: two spaces after a period is standard practice.  This may be avoided in programming for space-saving reasons - I don't know - but it really helps the reader find their way through a paragraph.)MB: A ladder leads upwards.Block 26: [The floor panel is flashing rhythmically: it must have some special function.]MB: The floor panel is flashing rhythmically, as if performing some special function.-or- (for a more subtle hinting)MB: For some reason, the floor panel flashes rhytmically.Block 27: [A broken fluorescent tube.](Ok.)Block 28: [Tom puts the gun in the wall cupboard.  "Right. Now, if I can get to the cupboard from the other side of this drain, I'll have fooled the Secus, and the gun will be mine!"]MB: Tom puts the gun in the cupboard.  "Right.  Now if I can get to the cupboard from the other side of this drain, I'll fool the Secus and the gun will be mine!"Block 29: [THAT'S ALL, FOLKS !]MB: THAT'S ALL, FOLKS!-or- (as Porky Pig, the originator of the quote)MB: TH-TH-TH-THAT'S ALL, FOLKS!Block 30: [Load Picture:](I have no idea what this mean, but it's fine.)Block 31: [Start FLC:](Ditto Block 30)Block 32: [Play part of FLC:](Ditto Block 30)Block 33: [Leave Script.](Ditto Block 30)Block 34: ["Nice start, Driscoll."](Ok.)Block 35: ["Thanks, I'm in the mood for flying today.  There's a lot of routine stuff in my job, but flying to a new planet still gives me a buzz!"]MB: "Thanks, I'm in the mood for flying today.  My job's pretty routine, but flying to a new planet still gives me a thrill!Block 36: ["You're telling me! Don't tell my boss, but I'd go without my pay to experience that feeling again!"]MB: "You're telling me!  Don't tell my boss, but I'd give up a paycheck to feel that again!"Block 37: ["We're coming into range!  Take a look at that, Hofstedt! Doesn't look like a barren planet to me."]MB: "We're in range!  Take a look, Hofstedt!  That doesn't look like a barren planet to me!"Block 38: ["You're right! There are plenty of clouds, and they're the wrong colour for dust clouds."](I'm guessing a bit here.  At times people confuse "and" and "but".)MB: " You're right!  There are plenty of clouds, but they're the wrong color for dust clouds."Block 39: ["I'll talk to the TORONTO. Meanwhile, you try to pick up something on the instruments. Shuttle to TORONTO! Ned, how do you read me?"]MB: "I'll try the TORONTO - you try to pick something up on instruments.  Shuttle to TORONTO!  Ned, how do you read?" Block 40: ["Reading you loud and clear, Mr. Driscoll. Can you see your objective?"]MB: "Read you loud and clear, Mr. Driscoll.  Can you see your objective?"Block 41: ["Yes. The planet doesn't look much like a desert, though. Mr. Hofstedt is checking the instruments."](Ok.)Block 42: ["Interes..ng. Oh, I th..k the conn..tion is gett... weaker. Please cont..ue."](Changed the elipses to dashes for the way it looks.  Changed the last two words around for imperative effect.)MB: "Interes--ng.  I th--k the conn--tion is gett--- we--er.  Conti--- p--ase."Block 43: ["It's difficult to take measurements because of the thick cloud layer.  Analysis indicates large quantities of raw materials... Seems to be more water than we..."](Ok.)Block 44: ["Just... moment, Mr. Hofst..t. The connec... is gett... weaker.

Servos out of action! Emergency circuits going down fast! Trying to do something manually! Hofstedt?"] (Jurie, I've been deleting some of these: ^^, where they show up between sentences in your blocks.  I figure they're part of the code, and not the actual text.  Just so you know.)MB: "Wow, looks like I spoke too soon!  Servos are out!  Emergency circuits are failing fast!  Try manual!  Hofstedt!"Block 47: ["Trying to carry out a check!"]MB: "Attempting a check!"Block 48: ["Mr. Dr..coll? Your status indic...s crit.cal values. Please report!"](See approach used for Block 42.)Block 49: ["Several systems out of action! Manual control O.K.! Trying to turn round!"]("turn round" should be "turn around" at the very least - and "reverse course" might be more evocative.)MB: "Several systems out!  Manual control responding!  Attempting to reverse course!"Block 50: ["We're having problems with the power supply. I... HEY!"](Ok.)Block 51: ["That was some bang! Damn, I'm losing control!  Hold tight, Hofstedt! WE'RE GOING DOWN!"](Ok.)Block 52: [The Shuttle is now within the planet's gravitational pull and is hurtling down towards it! The small craft is rocked by violent shocks as it enters the planet's atmosphere. Tom works feverishly and manages to make a bumpy crash landing... Slowly the men regain consciousness.]MB: The Shuttle, caught by gravitational pull, hurtles toward the planet!  The small craft is rocked by shocks as it enters the atmoshpere.  Tom works frantically and manages a bumpy crash landing....  Slowly, the men regain consciousness.Block 53: ["Ohh, my head!  Remind me not to fly with you again, Driscoll."]MB: "Oh..., my head!"  Remind me not to fly with you again, Driscoll."Block 54: ["At least, not in this old Shuttle.^^Anyway, you should thank me for saving your life! The automatic pilot would never have brought this old crate down safely!"]MB: "At least not in this old Shuttle.  Anyway, you should thank me for saving your life!  The autopilot wouldn't have brought this old crate down in one piece!"Block 55: ["O.K., O.K. I get the picture.^^Now what?"](Ok. - by which I mean this reads fine, not that you should change O.K. to Ok.  Okay?)Block 56: ["Now we grab our masks and get out of here. ^^If the air's breathable, we'll go through the spares and try to build a makeshift transmitter.^^If the air's not breathable...

I don't believe what I'm seeing! Take a look!"](Ok.)Block 59: ["Fantastic! Take a deep breath! Just listen! This place is teeming with life!"](Ok.)Block 60: ["The data the probe sent were way off! This is sensational!"]("were" may be correct, but to ninety-nine out of a hundred people "was" is going to sound right.  I'd change it if "were" isnt in keeping with the character speaking the line.)MB: The data the probe sent was way off!  This is sensational!"Block 61: ["Let's get out of the Shuttle.

At first, the general consensus was that the research team had been fooling around with sub-atomic particles, but after the data concerning their experiments had been extracted from their databanks (which were luckily stored in a data-node far away from the epicenter), the truth came to the light. Soon after, a ceremonial plaque commemorating the scientists and their sacrifice for humanity was placed next to the crater.It didn t take very long for everyone to realize that the development of a practical form of interstellar travel opened up a whole new world, no, a whole galaxy that could be exploited. This came as a relief to the multinationals who were becoming a bit worried since Mother Earth seemed to slowly sink into a catatonic state. In a rare fit of cooperation, the ruling companies planned the best way to go about the exploitation of the universe in a neat and efficient manner.The initial enthusiasm dampened a bit when the costs of an expedition towards another star were  calculated. The over-c drive takes one from one star to another, but in order to get far enough away from any large centers of gravity, conventional propulsion methods are still needed. The costs of a ship which could carry enough machinery to exploit an entire planet and could send back the raw materials and hold a crew, were, well, astronomical. So it was decided that if the Earth was going to send out a ship to a distant planet, it better be a damn good one.In 2229 the Deep Probe was catapulted perpendicular to the plane of ecliptic to far outside the solar system, where it had a clear view of the universe and could sniff the surrounding star systems, looking critically at each planet, scanning it for valuable materials. Data was sent back to Earth where it was continuously evaluated by the company AI s. Most were rejected. Some were considered, but the companies wanted to make as much profit as possible. Then they discovered what was later called the Nugget.It was a medium-sized planet, circling around a star called Fabricotti 342 at about the same distance as the Earth circled the sun. It had two moons. When it s data was scrutinized by the AI s, a lot of lights started flashing excitedly and CEOs around the world were called away from whatever they were doing, top priority. On the Deep Probe scale of interesting planets, from 0 to 100, this one rated 150. On the star-maps it stuck out like a sore thumb. No other planet had such a high concentration of valuable raw materials. Whatever room beneath it s surface wasn t filled by mineral oil or uranium was crammed full of rare elements. <<Well, first things first.  As far as writing English well, you're doing fine.  In the first paragraph, you say "...came to the light."  The phrase is "came to light," but I'm not even sure here that it was an error instead of just a typo.  Your communication in English is good, and you're handling the American vernacular well, too.  Honestly, I usually forget that you're not just sitting in a room in Florida or Oregon, USA.The next hurdle is writing with strength and precision, and here you're a bit soft, but that's only compared to what I try to get out of myself.  What you've written here conveys what I think you want it to convey, but you can get a lot more out of it simply by cutting, editing and focusing your thoughts.  I'll redo the first two paragraphs to shows what I mean:"In 2227, Earth made its first step into the universe when a group of scientists accidentally discovered the over-c drive.  At exactly the same time they also learned its first and most important rule of use: do not activate the over-c drive near a large center of gravity.  Upon initially violating this first and most important rule, the general consensus was that the research team had been fooling around with sub-atomic particles.  But then the data concerning the experiments was extracted from databanks stored in a data-node far away from the epicenter, and the truth came to the light.  A ceremonial plaque commemorating the scientists and their sacrifice was placed next to the crater."It didn't take long for everyone to realize that the development of a practical form of interstellar travel would open up a whole new world - a whole galaxy - that could be exploited.  This relieved multinationals who were becoming worried as Mother Earth seemed to slowly sink into a catatonic state.  In a rare fit of cooperation, the ruling companies planned to go about the exploitation of the universe in a neat and efficient manner."What I've done there for the most part is simply cut words that end up being "soft."  "Just" and "very" are the all-time leading vote-getters for soft words; look for them first.  (Contrast: "I love you very, very, very, very, much." vs. "I love you."  Which one is concrete; which one seems to defeat itself by trying to prove itself?)  The other changes I made were to tighten up the language and focus the emphasis.Now, the last stage of all this is creating a narrative (emotional) effect.  Your tone includes some humor, but I think you also want to add a sense of danger and foreboding for the reader - give them the idea that they don't know everything, even though it seems like you're being honest.  Here's the same two paragraphs with another pass for emotional effect:"In 2227, Earth made its first faltering step into the universe when a group of scientists accidentally discovered the over-c drive.  At the same time they unfortunately learned its first and most important rule of use: do not activate the over-c drive near a large centre of gravity.  In the tragic aftermath the general consensus was that the research team had been fooling around with sub-atomic particles.  But when the data concerning the experiments was extracted from databanks stored far from the epicenter, the truth of the cosmic over-c drive came to the light.  In memory of their sacrifice, a ceremonial plaque commemorating the scientists was placed next to the shadowed crater."It didn't take long for everyone to realize that the development of a practical form of interstellar travel would open up the galaxy for exploration...and exploitation.  Earth-bound and cramped multinationals seized on the new frontier, eager to abandon Mother Earth's catatonic state.  So great were the opportunities, the ruling companies conspired to go about exploitating the universe in a neat and efficient manner."That's probably not great stuff, but you can see what I mean.  I think there's a hint of "what's to come" there, and that's really the stock in trade of the storyteller: set the audience up for what's about to happen.  I wouldn't be reluctant to use what you've written, but I also wouldn't hesistate to find someone who can really nail this for you because there's no substituting for professionalism in any aspect of a product.If you keep writing I think you're going to figure out all this yourself, because that's all most of this is.  Writing problems are writing problems - you can't figure them out just by looking.  So I hope that's the kind of response that's helpful, and that it doesn't piss you off or beat you down.  The best advice I ever got about writing was given by an old teacher of mine: "You've got to have enough of an ego to take all the shit you're going to have to take, but not too much to listen when people are right."  I try to be that way all the time.As for the language that I read in all the blocks, the dialogue, etc., it's pretty good, but it's also pretty uniform.  I don't know how the other versions play, but the bits of the American version I've read seem to have a common vocabulary, tone and pace across the different characters, so you may want to try to differentiate them a little if you can.  So you won't think I'm nit-picking, my best friend leveled that complaint at some of the characters in a script I just shipped out to L.A. and he was right - I went back in a made some changes.Good luck with the project.  I had fun looking under the hood.>> To find out the rest, you'll have play the game!  I will send you a copy as soon as the English version is ready. <<Great, I'm looking forward to it!Mark  Distribution:  Blue Byte 100064,3503
