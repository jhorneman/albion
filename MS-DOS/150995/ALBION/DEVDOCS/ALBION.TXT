["Thanks, I'm in the mood for flying today.^^There's a lot of routine stuff in my job, but flying to a new planet still gives me a buzz!"]

Block 37:
["We're coming into range!^^Take a look at that, Hofstedt! Doesn't look like a barren planet to me."]

["Reading you loud and clear, Mr. Driscoll. Can you see your objective?"]

["Ohh, my head!^^Remind me not to fly with you again, Driscoll."]

["Now we grab our masks and get out of here. ^^If the air's breathable, we'll go through the spares and try to build a makeshift transmitter.^^If the air's not breathable... Good night, sweet Prince."]

I had that crazy dream again. Every time it gets... clearer."]

Block 121:
["It sure is crazy. You're not usually such a sensitive soul. It must be something to do with the over-c - leap. Stay with me tonight, and I'll make you forget these silly nightmares!"]

Block 122:
["The dream began before that, and it isn't really a nightmare. It's just so intense!^^ Ah, what the hell. I'm going for a walk.
Maybe I'll meet Captain Brandt and find out when I'm supposed to take off with Snoopy."]

Block 123:
["Snoopy? Didn't you...? Wow, you must really be a deep sleeper. You could hear the explosion all over the segment!"]

["Explosion? What explosion do you mean? What are you talking about, Chris? What's happened to Snoopy?"]

Block 125:
["The Inspector was sitting at the over-c comcontrols during the leap.
The equipment overloaded and just blew up. They say they found Snoopy's remains all over the place."]

Block 126:
["That's terrible! I just can't believe it! That means now Hofstedt is the only government official on board."]

Block 127:
["Yes, I've heard he'll be coming with you on the reconnaissance flight instead of Snoopy."]

Block 128:
["What a great start to the day. Oh well, Hofstedt's not so bad, and the accident probably won't make any difference to my flight plan. I'll have a talk with Joe about it."]

Block 129:
["Your pal's been assigned to the "north-east" of the segment today, near the entrance to the Comroom.^^ O.K., it's time I was going. I've got a lot of work to do. See you later, honey."]

[{INK 001}This is Rainer Hofstedt, physicist and xenobiologist and a government supervisory official. He begins to speak excitedly.]

Block 135:
["Driscoll! I'm glad I've met you! Have you heard about Inspector Beegle's death?"]

Block 136:
["Hello, Hofstedt. Yes, my partner just told me about it. It must have been a horrific sight."]

Block 137:
["That obstinate British idiot! I know he wasn't a technician, but he must have known how difficult it is to control the Comsystem during the over-c leap. We still don't fully understand this super-light technology yet. Poor devil!"]

Block 138:
["That makes you the only government official on board, doesn't it?"]

Block 139:
["The only nosey parker, yes. Don't remind me!^^ Anyway, I just talked to Captain Brandt. He wants to go ahead with the flight, with yours truly instead of Beegle.^^
Looks like you've got a new passenger, Driscoll."]

Block 140:
["I don't want to sound hard-hearted, but it makes no difference to the Shuttle which two people are on board. I don't see why the flight shouldn't go ahead as planned."]

Block 141:
["I must admit, I'm really looking forward to the flight. We should be taking off in the next few days. We'll have to wait for a message from the Captain."]

Block 142:
["That's right.^ I'll see you before then. See you later, Hofstedt!"]

Block 147:
["Hi, Tom. Sorry, I'm in a bit of a hurry. Heavy duty rota! See you later."]

Block 148:
["Hello, Tom. I'd like to see what the Comroom looks like since Snoopy got killed. Pity the Secus are guarding it."]

["Hello, Driscoll. Having a look at the Shuttle? Don't worry, everything's fine."]

Block 285:
["That's a racist term, Driscoll. The Grik'tra were a cultured race with a history two hundred thousand years longer than our own. There were only a few thousand of them when the Earth virus wiped them out."]

Block 286:
["Gaia shows that we seem to be incapable of learning from the mistakes of our own history. In our euphoria after the invention, or rather discovery, of over-c, Gaia had the misfortune to be the first planet we found which could sustain human life. The discovery of intelligent inhabitants, the Hoika, caused more of a sensation than the successful over-c tests; but that didn't stop the settlers treating the Hoika the same way many races were treated on Earth in the colonial period. Today we can see just how exceptional Gaia was, because it's still the only world we've found where human beings can live for long periods."]

Block 287:
["The Comsystem is supposed to have been totally destroyed. Personally, I didn't get on particularly well with Inspector Beegle. I wish I knew what he was doing fooling with the system during the leap.^ The high-energy over-c communication is so fantastically expensive, we evidently don't carry enough spares to repair the system."]

Block 288:
["I guess the conversion to a factory plant won't be possible now. I'm not even sure the TORONTO will be able to take off again unless we do something else."]

Block 289:
["You know, I used to be an active Environmentalist myself, until the radical wing got more and more involved in terrorism. But the official part of the organisation did achieve some great successes. Fortunately, since the tiger was genetically re-created last year, the public has been more positively disposed towards the Environmentalists. Since these scandals have been taking place on other planets, the condition of the last nature reserves on Earth has improved noticeably."]

Block 290:
["I think Brandt's OK. He's fascinated by Ned, our
AI. Could be because he started off as a software engineer."]

Block 294:
["Bongiorno, honey. What's new?"]

Block 295:
["If everything goes OK, and I think it will, we'll have to strap ourselves in for about 45 minutes. By then, the landing will be completed and the segments of the ship will have opened out horizontally. The segments will have the correct gravitational pull in them. Don't forget to stow the stuff in your cabin securely."]

Block 296:
["Don't worry, honey. The systems and all the back-up circuits are working fine. It'll all go like clockwork."]

Block 297:
["I envy you and Hofstedt. You'll be the first people ever to set eyes on Nugget. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you, Tom. Take care of yourself, you hear?"{WRNR0200}{WRNR0186}]

["You can't get that dream out of your head, can you? It's weird the way it keeps coming back. But it's not really a nightmare. It's bound to go away sooner or later."]



Hi Mark.

That was weird, wasn't it? I warned you the texts were all out of context. Oh well, just as a bonus (?), here's a little text I wrote right at the beginning of the product. We'll be using it in the manual. Although I wrote this down pretty quickly, I would still like to know what you think of it (don't hold back! Basically your opinion will help me evaluate my English and writing skills, and based on this I will decide whether to put in more effort or leave it altogether).

Thanks again!

Jurie.



				Prologue

In 2227, Earth made it›s first step on the road to the universe when a group of scientists accidentally discovered the over-c drive and, at exactly the same time, it›s first and most important rule of use : do not activate near a large centre of gravity. At first, the general consensus was that the research team had been fooling around with sub-atomic particles, but after the data concerning their experiments had been extracted from their databanks (which were luckily stored in a data-node far away from the epicenter), the truth came to the light. Soon after, a ceremonial plaque commemorating the scientists and their sacrifice for humanity was placed next to the crater.

It didn›t take very long for everyone to realize that the development of a practical form of interstellar travel opened up a whole new world, no, a whole galaxy that could be exploited. This came as a relief to the multinationals who were becoming a bit worried since Mother Earth seemed to slowly sink into a catatonic state. In a rare fit of cooperation, the ruling companies planned the best way to go about the exploitation of the universe in a neat and efficient manner.

The initial enthusiasm dampened a bit when the costs of an expedition towards another star were  calculated. The over-c drive takes one from one star to another, but in order to get far enough away from any large centers of gravity, conventional propulsion methods are still needed. The costs of a ship which could carry enough machinery to exploit an entire planet and could send back the raw materials and hold a crew, were, well, astronomical. So it was decided that if the Earth was going to send out a ship to a distant planet, it better be a damn good one.

In 2229 the Deep Probe was catapulted perpendicular to the plane of ecliptic to far outside the solar system, where it had a clear view of the universe and could sniff the surrounding star systems, looking critically at each planet, scanning it for valuable materials. Data was sent back to Earth where it was continuously evaluated by the company AI›s. Most were rejected. Some were considered, but the companies wanted to make as much profit as possible. Then they discovered what was later called the Nugget.
It was a medium-sized planet, circling around a star called Fabricotti 342 at about the same distance as the Earth circled the sun. It had two moons. When it›s data was scrutinized by the AI›s, a lot of lights started flashing excitedly and CEOs around the world were called away from whatever they were doing, top priority. On the Deep Probe scale of interesting planets, from 0 to 100, this one rated 150. On the star-maps it stuck out like a sore thumb. No other planet had such a high concentration of valuable raw materials. Whatever room beneath it›s surface wasn›t filled by mineral oil or uranium was crammed full of rare elements.

Hm. That's where I stopped, obviously. Writer's block, I guess. To find out the rest, you'll have play the game! I will send you a copy as soon as the English version is ready (hopefully a Christmas present).
