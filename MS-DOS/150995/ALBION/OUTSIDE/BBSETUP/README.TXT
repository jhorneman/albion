ReadMe zur Preview-Version von ALBION


WILLKOMMEN ZUR PREVIEW-VERSION VON ALBION!
Die CD enthÑlt fast alle Szenarien, von denen aber nur die ersten 2 teilweise spielbar sind. Die anderen Szenarien enthalten noch nicht die komplette (oder gar keine) Logik, geben aber einen Eindruck von der graphischen Vielfalt des Spieles. Unten ist eine genauere Doku zum augenblicklichen Stand der Dinge zu finden. Da wir ein wenig unter Zeitmangel leiden (welch eine öberraschung), haben wir die Doku in Englisch gehalten, sorry.


FöR DIE EILIGEN DAS WICHTIGSTE IN KöRZE:
Die vorliegende Version enthÑlt noch viele Provisorien und fehlende Teile, die zur Folge haben, da· der Handlungsfaden nicht ganz so deutlich prÑsentiert wird, wie in der fertigen Version (provisorische Zwischensequenzen, wichtige Dialogpartner "jagen" die Party noch nicht). Man sollte jedoch das erste Szenario an Bord des Raumschiffes problemlos, und das zweite, auf dem Planeten, mit etwas "Mut zur LÅcke" spielen kînnen.
Zum endgÅltigen Gameplay-"Feeling" des Spieles fehlt aber noch einiges, insbesondere die Mîglichkeit, seine Charaktere durch KÑmpfe und Golderwerb aufpÑppeln zu kînnen.


WAS NOCH FEHLT
- Kampflogik. Die Kampfschirme werden aufgerufen, die Monster tun aber noch nichts. Man kann aber die Effekte der Kampfzauber ausprobieren, wenn man einen geeigneten Spielstand lÑdt (siehe TIPS.)
- Szenarien. Wie gesagt, nur wenige beinhalten die volle Logik.
- Ein Haufen Kleinigkeiten tun noch nicht: Partystatus, Charakterwerteausgaben, HeiltrÑnke etc.


WICHTIGE TIPS
- Cheatmode on/off: F12. Man kann dann z.B. durch Hindernisse laufen, hat im Kampfbildschirm mehr Zauber und kann mit Personen fremder Sprachen sprechen. Voller Automapper, klick auf Position im Automapper teleportiert Party.

- Screengrabber: F4 (LBM-Format). Tut nicht in allen Screens.

- Um schnellen Zugang zu allen Graphiksets (2D und 3D) zu erhalten, startet man das Programm folgenderma·en:
ALBION DEMO
Man kommt in eine Cheat-Map und ist mit vielen Partymitgliedern ausgerÅstet. Mit F7 landet man immer wieder in dieser Map. Hinter jeder TÅr ist ein anderes Graphikset!

- F8 ruft einen Kampfbildschirm auf. Darauf achten, da· der bÑrtige Zauberer in der Party ist (DEMO - Modus), er kann die meisten Kampfzauber (F 12 aktivieren!).

- Speichern/Laden. Ist noch provisorisch. Mit F9 kann man einen Spielstand unter einer Nummer speichern. Anschlie·end irgendeinen Namen eingeben. Geladen wird ein Spielstand, indem man beim Starten
ALBION LOAD X
eingibt, wobei X die Nummer des gespeicherten Spielstandes ist.

- Das Intro ist als FLC auf der CD. Zum flÅssigen Betrachten am besten auf die Platte spielen. FLC-Player ist im gleichen Verzeichnis.

- Doppelklick linke Maustaste in 3D bei verschiedenen Richtungspfeilen ergibt nÅtzliche Drehungen.

This document accompanies a preview version of Albion, the role-playing game currently being developed by Blue Byte for PC CD-ROM. This document explains how to install and use this version.

Please keep in mind at all times that this is only a preview version of Albion. Many features are already present, but others are incomplete or are missing altogether. This version is only intended to give you an idea of what the final version of Albion will look like.

--- HOW TO INSTALL ALBION ---

To install Albion, change to the Albion directory on your CD-ROM drive and type SETUP. A preliminary version of our installation program will be started and will help you install Albion. Do not forget to select your CD-ROM drive. Momentarily you cannot configure your sound hardware from within the installation program. To do this you must type SETSOUND after installation (from your hard drive!). If you have trouble running our installation program because you do not have a VESA driver, type SETUP \VGA.

--- HOW TO START ALBION ---

Just type ALBION. When you leave Albion, the program may show some warnings because the game is still under development. You can safely ignore these.

To view Albion's combat screen, type ALBION2. You will directly enter the combat screen with a party containing several powerful magicians. Try out the different spells to see early versions of the special combat effects.

!IMPORTANT! Albion will run on a 4 Mb machine. However, the current version requires more than 4 megabytes of RAM.


--- IMPORTANT FEATURES OF ALBION ---

- A lot of attention has been put into making sure there is a good, mature story with interesting and complex characters, and a fascinating and realistic game world.

- There are many different cultures in Albion, each with their own distinct look and "feel".

- The game has been designed to offer months of playing fun not because the puzzles are so hard, but because there is just so much to do.

- The user interface is intuitive and easy to learn.

- The graphics are hand-drawn rather than rendered or scanned, creating a more intense atmosphere.

- The game features three different display systems : 2D for better orientation and exploration, 3D for more intense immersion (the "you are actually there" feeling), and a separate 3D system for the tactical combat screen.


--- THE AIM OF THE GAME ---

The aim of the game in Albion is to save the world. To do this, the player must travel and explore, talk to people, solve quests, fight, and improve the capabilities and equipment of the people in his or her party.


--- WHAT IS IN ALBION ---

- Maps.

This is the most important part of the game. There are four types of maps :

1. 2D surface maps. This is where the player gets to explore the planet's surface. The scale of these maps is larger than in the indoor maps, making everything appear smaller. There are three different climates, each with its own set of graphics : jungle, normal, and desert. From the surface maps, the player enters either dungeons or...

2. ...3D city maps. Cities are displayed using the 3D texture-mapping system. The player can explore the city and talk to its inhabitants. By entering houses, the player enters...

3. ...2D indoor maps. Here the player explores houses and buildings and talks to their occupants. These maps and the 3D city maps are where the differences between cultures are most obvious.

4. 3D dungeon maps. Many quests involve dark and gloomy dungeons, presented in glorious 3D-texturemappovision. Here the player uncovers ancient secrets and battles terrible foes.

- The automapper.

This screen allows the player to orientate him- or herself within 3D maps. In cities, the player can travel to places already visited using only one mouse-click. Normally the automapper only shows those parts which have already been visited by the player, but in cheat-mode the entire map can be seen.

- The tactical combat screen.

This is where conflicts between the party and groups of monsters are settled. Combat in Albion is a tactical rather than a real-time affair. The player enters actions such as move, attack, or cast a spell for each of the party members, and then starts the next combat round, which is then carried out. Each combat spell will have it's own special effect. Various effects are available in the current version.

- The inventory screen.

This is where the player can determine what each party member will wear and what items they will carry in their backpack. The player can also examine the statistics of all the different party members, although this is not in the current version yet.

- The dialogue screen.

Dialogues are an essential part of Albion, as they help to advance the story and deepen the feeling that the player is in a living, breathing world.


--- WHAT IS NOT IN ALBION, BUT WILL BE ---

- Lots and lots of exciting scenarios.
- More graphics!
- Lots of different monsters and other opponents in combat.
- Various different combat backgrounds.
- Three different status panels in the inventory screen, allowing you to access as detailed statistics as you desire.
- Lots of music (both MIDI and digital) and sound effects.
- More sound effects, especially in combat.
- Improved 2D & 3D controls. All steering is provisional at the moment.
- Beautiful still pictures and animations to illustrate crucial moments in the storyline.
- SGI-rendered, original intro.


--- HOW TO USE ALBION ---

(LMB means left mouse-button and RMB means right mouse-button.)

The basic user-interface concept is this :
- Anything that can be clicked on will be highlighted, and an explanation will appear at the bottom-right of the screen.
- Use the LMB to steer your party and to take action.
- If the mouse-pointer turns gold, click the RMB to access a pop-up menu.

In 2D maps, the mouse pointer changes shape depending on its position in relation to the party. Press and hold the LMB to make the party move in the appropriate direction. To perform actions, press and hold (!) the RMB. Move the mouse to select the square on which you want to perform the action.
Release the RMB. A pop-up menu appears with all the relevant actions. Use "Examine" to look at stuff and read signs. Use "Manipulate" to open doors and flip switches, and "Use item" to solve certain puzzles.

In 3D maps, the mouse pointer changes shape depending on its position in relation to the middle of the screen. The 3D map window is divided into nine areas.

Clicking (and holding) with the LBM performs the following functions:

Move forward and    |   Move forward      |     Move forward and
rotate left         |                     |     rotate right
--------------------+---------------------+--------------------------
Move left           |         -           |     Move right
--------------------+---------------------+--------------------------
Move backward and   |   Move backward     |     Move backward
turn left           |                     |     and turn right

The further you move away from the center, the faster you'll go. Sounds hard, is easy. Try it. The 3D controls will be improved in the final version.


Double-clicking with the LBM performs the following functions:

Turn 90 degrees     |      Look up        |    Turn 90 degrees
to the left         |                     |    to the right
--------------------+---------------------+--------------------------
      -             |         -           |           -
--------------------+---------------------+--------------------------
Turn 180 degrees    |     Look down       |     Turn 180 degrees
to the left         |                     |     to the right


You can access a pop-up menu by pressing the RMB in the middle of the screen, moving it around to select what you want to select, and then release the RMB.

In the inventory screen, move items from backpack to body and vice versa by dragging and dropping (note that you need not keep the LMB down while you're dragging).

In the combat screen, which you enter by pressing F8 or running into a monster, you can access a pop-up menu by pressing the RMB on a party member (in the tactical window). The monsters do not attack or move yet. Some of the functions, such as attacking, moving, and using magic already work.
Enter moves for each party member, then select "Start round" to see it all happen. Select "Exit combat" to leave the combat screen.

One of the party members, Khunag, can cast powerful magic in combat. Select one of his spells to see what magic will look like.

In the automapper you can exit by clicking with the RMB. Normally you will only see those parts of the automap that you have already visited. If you activate cheat mode before entering the automapper, you will see everything.

In the status area at the bottom of the screen, you can access a pop-up menu by pressing the RMB on a party member's portrait. You can talk to party members. You can also make someone the leader by pressing the LMB on their portrait, or access someone's inventory by double-clicking.

If you start the program with the parameter DEMO, the game begins in a specially created short-cut map. From this map you can access some of the maps currently in the game by running through the doors. To find out where a door leads to, examine the sign next to the door. To return to the short-cut map, press F7.
