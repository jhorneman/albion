With LIONHEART, you`re holding in your hands the
results of 16 month full of struggle, enthusiasm
and hard work. Four young and idealistic, but 
nevertheless PAID, people put a lot of effort into
it. Many colleagues called Thalion crazy to do
such a huge and expensive project on a pirate-
tormented machine as the Amiga. Instead of stopping
to support the Amiga, we`ll let the users decide 
whether it`s still possible to afford developing 
high quality software on this machine or not. If we
shouldn`t be able to cover at least our development
expense by the sales, LIONHEART will be the last 
action game by Thalion. 
So if you`ve spent your money on Lionheart: Thanks for 
giving us the chance to do something even better next
time, possibly.
If you`ve copied this game: Well, that`s your decision.
Live`s a series of decisions and their results. I hope 
you won`t go around complaining that there are no good
action titles for your machine anymore. Not we decide 
to quit developing those for the Amiga. You do. You did.
