Hi Simon,

here we go again! Enough babble for half the issue! Don´t take the parts about nagging journos 
personally, please, we just went out of decent jokes. After all, we should be glad to get a 2nd 
preview in the first place. As always, we´re very keen to see what becomes out of this (i.e. 
shell out an issue or three). 

Erik & the team


Another The One question list

- Ambermoon was originally planned for Easter 1993. Just why has it taken so long ?

K: Time shows us that Ambermoon is just to big for only 5 people working on it. Just the 
editing of the Lyramion world map took me over 2 months. 

J: Well... after Amberstar was finished, the entire team sat down together and we planned what 
we would do in Amberstar 2 (which wasn't called Ambermoon at that time yet). We made a 
long list of new features and changes, among which were an improved 3D system (this was 
before we had a working 3D texture-mapping  dungeon), an improved 2D system (with 
unlimited layering of graphics, higher walls which disappear when you walk behind them, etc.) 
and an isometric combat screen. This was in February or March of 1992.

So after having practically re-designed the entire game, we said to our manager : "We'll have 
it ready by Easter!"
And he said : "Oh, don't hurry. Take till August."
"Wow!", we said, "we got one and a half years! Brilliant!" and happily started working on the 
most amazing RPG ever.

Then the word from above came : "Er, August 1992, guys! It's got to be in the shops by 
Christmas!"

Uh-oh.

In this cruel manner do the greatest products perish before they see the light of day... We sat 
down again and just thought of small changes (like, a real-time texture-mapping dungeon) 
which we could make to the original Amberstar system so it would ready by Christmas 1992 , 
and then we started work on what was then called Amberstar One-and-a-half. (We still have 
some graphics from the original Amberstar 2. Maybe we'll show it one day.)

Then the conversion of the original Amberstar program from the Atari ST to the Amiga slowly 
turned into a re-write, the texture-mapping dungeon took longer than expected, the combat 
screen took longer than expected, changing the editors took longer than expected... and we 
discovered these neat things we could do if we just changed a little bit here and there...

Suddenly it was March 1993, and the end wasn't in sight yet. We sat down again and tried to 
estimate how long it was going to take, and this time we said : "Okay, August 1993. Really. 
Honestly." And we will probably actually make that! Give or take a month.

E: It seems to me, that we didn´t fully realize what a bloody huge project we are creating 
before a few weeks ago when we counted our data. It was a weird feeling that obviously we 
did manage to do an RPG of a size which usually you only see on the Pee Cee, done by U.S. 
teams 5 times as large as we are.
Despite this, there are these journos nagging around about AMBERMOON all the time and 
why it has taken so long... 
Hey, Simon, come right back here! No offense meant, old fruit. Wipe those tears away! Calm 
down!

- Was the game harder to program than you anticipated ?

K: Ask Jurie about that. I've only programmed the editors for Ambermoon. And I took over the 
editors from Amberstar and have changed about 30% of the code.

J: Not harder. It just took longer. Mastering the Amiga with it's complex operating system and 
custom hardware took a lot less time and effort than I expected (some of my colleagues, who 
remember my graceful reaction to inexplainable bugs caused by wrong use of the blitter, and 
what I did to the office doors and walls, may have a different opinion on this, but what do they 
know anyway ?) Looking back, few routines were really hard. However, in the phase where we 
are now the program contains more code than the Atari ST operating system... and that's all 
hand-typed. The separate parts of an RPG are usually quite easy to program. It's making it all 
stick together which is hard.

E: Now that I´m fully involved in editing a part of the game´s quests I can say that it is a hell 
of a lot work. But that´s alright, because most of the work comes from the fact that we can do 
much more complex actions and reactions than in AMBERSTAR. The whole system is much 
more flexible, and if that means more game design work, it´s okay with me.

- How has the game changed over the months ?

K: It has changed in many different ways. All through the development we had new ideas. And 
when I was lucky Jurie told me: "OK, it's no work to change this part of the program, I will do 
it."

J: Well, I've already told the story of how Ambermoon came to be. However, every part of the 
game has been re-designed as we went along, because it is usually during the actual 
programming that you can best judge what is possible and what isn't.

E: Yes, it´s bizarre. We wanted to do a modestly improved follow up, and came out with a 
monster of an RPG. Don´t send our managing director a copy of this issue!

- Have you had to leave anything out and if so why ?

K: Well, no major things. Always when Jurie told me that it cost to much time to change that 
part of the program.

J: No, not really.  Off the top of my head, I cannot think of any major feature which we didn't 
manage to cram in somehow. This is an amazing method which I can recommend to all our 
colleagues : you make a very modest design of your game and then just go wild expanding it 
as you go along. This way, the end result always exceeds your original expectations. Of course, 
developing the game will also take slightly longer than you may have planned originally.

E: Yes, and you´ll probably will starve before you see the end of the project! At least if you´re 
a free-lancer.

- Has the game turned out the way you expected when you originally began work ?

K: It's now much better. Jurie has done great work on the Inventory System and the 
Battlescreen. They are now much better than I thought about them at the start of Ambermoon.

J : No. It became much, much better. We originally planned to do a sort of upgraded version of 
Amberstar. Now even the game's own mother wouldn't recognize it.

E: Well, actually, I wanted to have this real-time raytracing thingy which was supposed to run 
in full-screen HAM-mode at 25 frames per second and...  ow! Stop that! Bugger off, Jurie! 
Your not supposed to beat up your bleedin´ boss! Ouch!

- How do you rate Ambermoon compared to the other RPG's ? How do you justify this 
claim ?

K:On the the Amiga it will be the best RPG at this time. The reason is that no other company 
put so much work into the program than we. For my person I lost my holidays this year. 

J : I have never played any other RPG's long enough to be able to answer this properly, but I 
think Ambermoon will compare favourably to anything else out there, including all those 
flashy PC titles.

E: Karsten´s certainly right. If there shouldn´t creep an ever bigger and badder monster of an 
RPG out of some dark cave of mutated developers, we should be able to beat all current 
Amiga-RPG´s in size (see number of disks below), technique (dungeons & fighting screen), 
graphics (e.g. over 170 different walls, over 350 dungeon objects, 25 or more fully animated 
monsters etc.), sound (over 30 tunes) complexity and playing time. And due to Juries effort to 
brush up the user interface it´s no crappy marketing blah-blah when I say that RPG 
newcomers won´t have problems to get into the game.

- Has it been worth all the effort ?

J : Definitely.

E: Do you know what I´m saying to you if you ask me that after a weekend in front of the 
RPG-editor system? Why, of COURSE it has!

- How many disks do you envisage the game coming on ? What's the reason for this ?

J : We think we probably won't exceed nine disks, excluding the save-game disk. What do you 
think the graphic artists and our musician, Matthias Steinwachs, did during the last one-and-
a-half years ?

E: May I repeat my statement when I heard this the first time: Aaarrgh!

- How is the 3D section looking now ? Could we have some technical specs, please ?

K: It's looking great. On a normal Amiga 500, it's not as smooth as Ultima Underworld on a 50 
MHz PC of  course,  but you really will get into it. And then it's a great fun to play. Technical 
xpecs - ask Jurie.

J: The 3D texture-mapping system has been refined time and time again (as has everything 
else in the game). We have tried to exploit every possible feature to the full. The camera height 
changes depending on what race the current leader of your party belongs to, or whether you're 
climbing down stairs or up through a hole in the ceiling. On 68020+ machines (like the Amiga 
1200), you can activate textures on the floors and ceilings. We have transparent walls. We 
have objects which are distorted realistically (i.e. true to perspective) depending on the camera 
height. The horizon is higher up in dungeons than in cities to increase the claustrophobic 
atmosphere (because you feel closer to the ceiling). The graphics in 3D dungeons smoothly 
fade to black depending on the strength of your light-spell. In 3D cities, we have a beautiful 
colour range in the sky, and various different background graphics on the horizon.
Also, in cities the graphics and the sky colours do not fade to black, but to a different palette! 
There's one set of colours for day, one for dawn and dusk, and one for night, and these three 
sets are different for each planet you can visit. At night, stars slowly appear in the sky, and 
these are different for each planet as well!

On a bog-standard Amiga 500, the dungeon currently runs at about 5 frames per second. This 
is slower than a certain other texture-mapping dungeon system we all know, but our display 
window is three times as big and our system is simply used better because we had more time. 
On an Amiga 1200, you can activate floor- and ceiling-textures and the dungeon runs at over 
10 frames per second. On an Amiga 2000 with a 25Mhz 68030 board, the special routines
kick in and the dungeon runs at 17 to 25 frames per second. All movements in the game are 
independent of the frame rate at which the dungeon runs, so you don't get any unfair 
advantages if you have a faster Amiga.

We could have made the dungeon faster simply by removing all the objects lying around, but 
we chose to make the game more atmospheric, to increase the player's enjoyment, by including 
lots of details in the cities and dungeons.
Of course we always make sure that the game remains playable. Even though the game is 
programmed on a 68030 machine, new quests and sub-adventures are tested on a normal 
Amiga 500, so we don't run the risk of overdoing it and making a game which can only be 
enjoyed by rich bastards with a 68030 or better. And always remember that the 3D texture-
mapping dungeon is only a small part of the actual game!

E: Jurie, does the term 'slow and horrible death' have a meaning to you? I don´t want to hear 
about the different star constellations on the moon cities again! Not a living soul in the known 
universe will ever notice that!
Ok, now that I got rid of that, let me add that we spent a long time on optimizing the steering. 
You have a lot of different steering possibilities that enable you to move quickly even in 
situations when dozens of objects slow things down on a standard Amiga. And if some 
arrogant 66 MHz PC owner complains about Ambermoon on your A 500, tell him to show you 
Legends of Valour or Underworld on a 8 MHz 8088 XT without a VGA - card !

- What has been the hardest part for you ?

K: The editing of the worldmap. The lyramion Worldmap has 256 parts and it was a hell of a 
lot of work to edit all these maps.

J: What took the most time, effort and thought were :
 1 - Incorporating Michael Bittner's dungeon routines into the Ambermoon game system.
 2 - Writing the combat screen. Although I programmed the game, the combat screen in 
Amberstar was written by Michael Bittner. This time, I had to do it all by myself without any 
previous experience.

The parts which are the most complex and of which I'm the proudest are :
 1 - The memory manager, which is quite intelligent and can dramatically reduce loading 
times.
 2 - The combat screen display system. This took some work, but I think it's quite impressive 
to shift around several shapes of up to 96 by 96 pixels using real-time zooming, in 32 colours, 
at an acceptable speed, on a normal Amiga. Also, in my slightly biased opinion, it looks 
brilliant. Internally, it is the same system used in Amberstar, but it looks a lot better!
 3 - The routines which allow you to move items around in the Inventory-screen. This is a 
good example of the rule that good code should be invisible. It gave me quite a headache, 
because there was a lot of logic involved, and I wanted to make this part as instinctive as 
possible.

E: I had quite a hard time to draw the graphic parts for the new worldmap system. It was my 
goal to have realistic proportions (not that party = tree = house = mountain - appeal) and to 
remove the blocky appearance that you often see in 2D-RPGs. That left me sitting before my 
DPaint-screen more thinking than drawing. It was a valuable experience. Especially all these 
nice new swear-words that I learned from Jurie when he realized that the surface gfx are 
taking 250 kB of his valuable chipmem! For ONE of the worlds, that is.

- When will the game be released ?

K: The German Amiga version will hopefully be released in September (of 1993), and the 
English version will follow shortly after.

J: The Atari ST version will follow one or two months later. We don't know when the PC 
version will be finished yet.

E: Dear Jurie and Karsten. You know that funny thing that happens to me when someone 
delays his deadline more than 3 times? Read the brilliant and utterly inspiring book 'American 
Psycho' !

J: Shut up and edit sub-quests.

E: Wack!

J: Ouch!


- Are you glad that it's almost over ?

K:Yeeeeeesssssssssssss.

J : The deadline stress on Ambermoon isn't as tough as it was on Amberstar, so I'm not 
yearning for the day when I'm finally through with this #&%!! project. But I'm glad we'll soon 
be able to say that it's ready, and that it's a project which really turned out well.

E: Agreed.

K/J/E : And now go away so we can get some work done !!!
