The TEXTS sub-directory contains all the text files that need translating.

The WRDCOUNT sub-directory contains the biggest two textfiles in a "raw"
format where you can do a wordcount without counting comments and
special commands in the text. DO NOT TRANSLATE THESE!

The TRANS.DOC is a Word for Windows 6.0 document containing a detailed
description of what needs to be done.
