Here you can find information that we
were unable to include in the manual.


THIS IS A PREVIEW
=================
Although the game itself is 100%
finished, the localization isn't.
We have translated a small part of the
game (1 scenario) for the purpose of
this preview. This means that:
- after the first scenario, all texts
 will be German. We apologize for this
 and suggest you just admire the
 graphics.
- the quality of the translated text
 in this preview is not as high as
 that in the final product. We know
 there are typos, and the texts aren't
 as polished as they will be when the
 full game is released.


PRE-SAVED GAMES
===============
For your convenience we have included
two saved games with the preview CD.
One will take you to a dungeon filled
with puzzles and monsters to fight.
The other will take you to our special
"cheat map". From here you can reach
various parts in the game (by walking
through the doors). This allows you to
see all the different scenarios in the
game without having to play the game
(or learn German).

See CHEAT MODE below on how to get
back to the cheat map.

CHEAT MODE
==========
The cheat mode is activated by
entering the options window from the
main menu and entering SCHNOSM (don't
ask). The screen will glow white to
indicate cheat mode is activated.

Once in cheat mode the following
special functions are available:

ALT-F4
Saves the content of the screen as
an LBM-file.

ALT-F7
Moves you to the cheat map.

ALT-F8
Enters the combat screen with various
interesting opponents. Do not press
this when you already are in the
combat screen.

ALT-F12
Toggles the cheat mode proper (as
indicated by the smiling face in the
corner of the screen). In this mode
you can walk through walls and are
safe from attack by monsters. In the
combat screen you can try any spell
you like. We recommend you do this to
see all the different effects we put
in at great personal expense.


NOT ENOUGH RAM?
===============
It is possible that ALBION reports it
does not find enough memory or that
memory is too fragmented.

In the long run you can remedy this
problem by removing programs from your
configuration (CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT) which are not essential,
such as SMARTDRV.EXE.

If you type ALBILOW instead of ALBION,
the problem is remedied automatically,
although the program will run slower
because your hard drive is being used
as virtual memory.
Please note that you need at least 16
megabytes of free space on your hard
drive to use ALBILOW.


TIP: WINDOWS 95
===============
Start the ALBION shortcut (the icon
with the MS-DOS symbol) instead of the
ALBION application.


TIP: WINDOWS 95 with 8MB RAM
============================
Although the game works with this
configuration, you may want to try and
play the game in MS-DOS mode.
Windows 95 employs virtual memory which
slows the program down.


WINDOWS 3.11
============
We recommend you to play ALBION using
DOS instead of Windows 3.11.
In most cases ALBION works fine with
Windows 3.11.


HARD DRIVE SPACE
================
ALBION runs almost completely from CD
and requires only very little hard
drive space. However, a saved game can
grow to about 300 kilobytes. If you
save a lot of games this will take up
quite a chunk on your hard drive.
Delete any old saved games (in the
SAVES subdirectory), if you need room
on your hard drive.


OPTIONS MENU
============
The options menu contains volume
controls for music and sound effects.
It also allows you to set the size of
the 3D window, as well as some
controls that allow you to customize
the combat screen.

COMBAT DETAIL LEVEL influences what
the combat spells look like. If some
effects slow down your computer, you
can speed them up using this slider.

COMBAT TEXT DELAY influences how long
the texts during the combat rounds are
shown. By changing this you change the
duration of the entire combat round.


ASKING PARTY MEMBERS TO LEAVE
=============================
If you want a member of your party to
leave (perhaps because you want to
take someone else with you), you can
ask him or her to leave during a
dialogue.
However, not everyone will leave at
any time during the game, which means
the option is not always available in
the dialogue screen.


WORD LIST DURING DIALOGUES
==========================
To help you remember which words you
have already asked about in a
dialogue, the already chosen words are
shown in SILVER, whereas the words you
haven't asked about yet are shown in
GOLD.


GOTO-POINTS IN CITIES
=====================
Please remember that you must have
reached a location before a goto-point
appears. It's not enough to have
"seen" the location in the automap.


SPELLS "SHOW OFF", "SHOCK" & "PANIC"
====================================
To successfully use these spells you
should know two things: first of all
the effect depends not only on the
spell strength, but can also be
improved by casting it more than once.
Second, hitting a monster (any
monster) helps to increase the
intimidating effect of these spells.


IF PROBLEMS SHOULD OCCUR
========================
We have tested ALBION for hundreds of
hours. However, if a problem occurs,
the program will play a tone on your
PC's internal speaker.

If the problem is not critical you
will be notified when you leave the
game. If the problem does not bother
you while playing, ignore it.

If the program is ended automatically,
or the problem stops you from playing,
you will find a file called ERROR.LOG
in the ALBION directory. The program
writes an error report in this file.

In this case contact our hotline:

(49) (0) 208 450 8888

and pass them the information in the
error log file.


DEMOS ON THE ALBION CD
======================
On the CD you will find several demos
of upcoming Blue Byte products. These
are stored in the AVI (Video for
Windows) format.
To watch the videos, start Windows and
start the program INSTALL.EXE in the
BBVIDEO directory on the CD. This
program will create a program group
and several icons. Double-click on an
icon to watch a video.

To watch the videos, Video for Windows
must have been installed on your PC.
For your convenience we have included
a Video for Windows installation
program.
