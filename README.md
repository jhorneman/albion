# Description

This repository contains files related to Albion, the role-playing game developed at Blue Byte Software GmbH between 1994 and 1996.

## Contents

### Archives
`Archives` contains compressed archives of most of the Amiga and MS-DOS files below.

### Amiga source code
`Amiga\src` contains part of the 68000 assembly source code of the original Amiga version of the game.

### MS-DOS source code and assets
`MS-DOS` contains snapshots of the C source code and assets of the MS-DOS version of the game.

We did not use source control back then: we just made occasional snapshots and burned those to CD. One of those backup CDs has recently 
come to light during a move.

### Documents
`Documents` contains some old documents.

* `DECSTORY.DOC` was some very early scene-setting for the Decadents: a group of humans in the game I was going to develop, but which was cut because I had no time to work on it.
* `TEKGUIDE.DOC` was the technical guide for the other people on the team. Please note that a) it's written in bad German, b) I cannot guarantee everything I wrote there worked, was used, or was even implemented.

### Miscellaneous

`Albion-backup-2`, `MORE`, and `PROJECT` contain additional backups of Albion-related files.
